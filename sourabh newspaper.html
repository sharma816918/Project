<br><p> Plastic pollution is one of the most critical environmental issues these days. It is the accumulation of plastic materials (like grocery bags, drink bottles, straws, food wrappers, plastic packaging, and microbeads) in the marine and wild environments. This accumulation adversely impacts both humans and wildlife. 1. Every year, about 8 million tons of plastic waste escapes from coastal nations into the oceans 1. This is like setting five garbage bags full of trash on every foot of coastline around the world 2. The latest studies indicated that microplastics are being eaten by animals 2. These microplastics could negatively impact their lives and human health because they can be stored in the animals’ tissues and cells for months. Scientists believe that the amount of plastic in the ocean might triple by 2050 3. Learn why microplastic pollution prevention matters and the most effective strategies that can be taken by individuals to decrease plastic waste, and say no to single-use plastic.</p>.<br><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/story/13891/things-you-need-to-know-about-indias-plastic-ban-2022/" target="_blank" title="google">read more</a>

<p1>Last year, in partnership with SYSTEMQ, a London-based environmental consulting firm, Pew (Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan fact tank) predicted that plastic waste in the marine environment will triple by 2040. Pew suggested the world should act urgently to eliminate plastic use and gain control of trash 6. According to a study in 2015, scientists found many developing nations with poor waste management 6. These nations have reported later improvements in waste management and the construction of infrastructure 6. Asian nations are one of the top five collections of nations that reported more gains. For example, China has reported about a 60% decrease in waste generation and a 51% reduction in inadequately managed waste. These decreases happened due to the rapid construction of incineration plants 6. In 2016, there were more than half of the 3.91 million metric tons of plastics gathered and exported outside the United States  6. There were about 88% of the plastics exported to nations lacking adequate resources to properly manage and process them  6. There were about 1 million metric tons of waste that were estimated by the team; This ended up polluting the marine environment outside the United States.</p1>
<p3> On July 1, 2022, the Indian government’s ban on selected single-use plastics came into effect. The banned plastic products include plastic cutlery, earbuds with plastic sticks, plastic flags, candy sticks, ice cream sticks, and decorative thermocol, among other items with ‘low utility and high littering potential’. While cracking down on disposable plastics is a step in the right direction, is a ban of this nature going to address the problem of plastic pollution?</br>

<br>Over the past decade, successive Indian governments have been working towards curtailing the use of single-use plastics through various policy measures. From bans to waste-to-energy plants, multiple strategies have been devised to tackle the ginormous plastic menace, but have had little to no impact on ground.</p3>
<p1>Citizens too have a big role in transitioning towards alternative products and sustainable practices. Buying lesser, better and more natural products is key to changing the course of the hyper consumerist market that we live in today. Within our homes, segregating at source gives us a sense of the waste that we are generating on an individual level too. We will need to be deeply conscious about our habituated consumption patterns while moving away from corporations that continue to pollute our environment, and consequently, affect our health.</br> 

<br>Within this discourse about plastic waste management, a crucial—and often unacknowledged—link are informal waste workers. They play a critical role in collecting and segregating recyclable plastic waste, ensuring environmental safety despite the dismal compensation and health risks. In Pune, for example, women-led self-employed waste workers extend door-to-door collection services, especially to the city’s impoverished areas, enabling greater recycling capacity and reducing ecological damage. In this journey away from single-use plastic, there is a need for formal mechanisms to ensure waste workers are provided with just livelihood transitions. Similarly, small and medium plastic manufacturing units, which employ more than 4 million workers, will also require supportive mechanisms to successfully transition away from plastic production.</p1></br>

<p2>According to the Central Pollution Control Board, India produced about 3.4 million tons of plastic in 2019-20. However, the real figures might be far higher. Plastindia Foundation—a major body of associations, organisations and institutions connected with plastics—suggests that India consumed 16.5 million tons of plastic in 2017-18 alone, highlighting a conspicuous divide between consumption and wastage. Currently, of the total plastic waste produced in the country, 60% is being ‘recycled’— most often converted into lower quality products such as pellets, granules or flakes—only, at best, delaying its entry into our soil, oceans and the food system. Additionally, the ban focusses on a few categories of single-use plastics, conveniently excluding the major plastic generators in the form of FMCG companies. FMCG or Fast Moving Consumer Goods companies, that manufacture our packaged chips, snacks, biscuits, soft-drinks, packaged dairy, packaged water, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, toothpaste, toiletries, cleaning liquids etc have been in repeated audits found to be the biggest generators of plastic waste. In fact, one waste audit found that nearly 30% of this plastic waste is multi-layered and cannot be commercially recycled. Then there is the fast fashion industry that has reinvented cheap, plastic fabric with greenwashing terminologies like vegan leather, crease-free and more. Studies show that nearly 60% of fabric fibres globally manufactured are plastic. With every purchase and every wash micro plastic fibres are getting washed away into our water bodies. The urgent need is to hold the big producers of plastic accountable for their products and bring in policies that will force them to switch to natural packaging material. The big producers i.e. FMCG industry must take responsibility for the plastic problem and re-evaluate its dependency on single-use plastics.</p2>
